The main aim of this research is to observe temperature and rainfall variability from the year of 1901 to 2023 and figure out which of decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression is the most applicable model for predicting rain and temperature in Bangladesh. 
The main objective of this project is to 
•	Observe temperature and rainfall variability from the year of 1901 to 2023
•	Assess and compare the performance of three adapted models: decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression in predicting rain and temperature
•	Figure out the most appropriate model for rain and temperature prediction based on the results of the performance metrics
